# Create a server on your machine
## Installation
### Download
First you have to download the setup of XAMPP, you can find it here: (download page)[https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html]. Choose your OS and then download it. Run the setup and follow the steps. Choose a directory to install it and wait a little bit.

### Launch
Open the XAMPP Control Panel. You may see a list of the services installed on your device by the setup. In this tutorial, we will use the first two, Apache (for the web server) and MySQL (for the databases). Click on the start button and wait until the name is collored on light green. Then, go on a web browser (as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) and type in the adress bar [localhost](http://localhost). If the installation successed you may have a XAMPP dashboard. Looks like this:

N.B. If you type [https://localhost](https://localhost), the brower will block your connection and display a red error message. It's because the HTTPS is based on SSL certificates and they have to be signed by an exterior company. The localhost certificate is auto-signed and webbrowser does'nt trust them. If you still want to acces on your page on HTTPS follow the following procedure:

* On Google Chrome (and chromium based browser): click on the `Advanced` button (bottom left) and then click on the link `Proceed to localhost (unsafe)`.
* On Mozilla Firefox: click on the `Advanced` button (bottom right) and then click on the `Accept the Risk and Continue` button (bottom right).

Otherwise you can type `http://` before (the communication will be not encrypted but it does'nt matter because the communication with your localhost is on local only and does'nt depend of the network).

Now, your local host is ready to use!
