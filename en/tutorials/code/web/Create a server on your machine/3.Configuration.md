# Create a server on your machine
## Configuration
### Create a webpage
Now, we will create a webpage on our server. First, you have to locate the installation directory of XAMPP, (`C:/xampp/` by default). Now, navigate to `/htdocs` folder (e.g. `C:/xampp/htdocs`). It's the root of the webserver, when you type `localhost`, you access to this folder. You have a folder named `/dashboard` created by XAMPP. You can delete it but I advise you to keep it. Create a folder named `/apps`. You will create your projects in this folder. It will be access by typing [localhost/apps/](https://localhost/apps). Create a new folder called `myFirstPrject` and open it with your code editor (I suggest Visual Studio Code: click with right button on the folder and click `Open with Code`). Create a file named `index.html` and fill it with the following code:

```
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<h2>This is my first project</h2>
```

Come back on your browser and type [localhost/apps/myFirstProject](http://localhost/apps/myFirstProject)

It will display the content of index.html.

N.B. [localhost/apps/myFirstProject](http://localhost/apps/myFirstProject) and [localhost/apps/myFirstProject/index.html](http://localhost/apps/myFirstProject/index.html) are the same because the webserver reach automaticly the `index.*` if only the folder path is specified. If the `html` file name was `page.html`, we should have typed [localhost/apps/myFirstProject/page.html](http://localhost/apps/myFirstProject/page.html). That's why the main page of a website is called `index.html`.

Now, you can create projects on your website!
